tutoIntro1=Welcome to your tamagotchi helper
tutoIntro2=Your tamagotchi has needs that must be met for its well-being.
tutoIntro3=To do this, you can use the following actions:
tutoAction1="Sleep", increases your Tamagotchi's energy stat.
tutoAction1Robot="Charge", increases your Tamagotchi's energy stat.
tutoAction2="Clean", increases your Tamagotchi's cleanliness stat.
tutoAction3="Eat", increases your Tamagotchi's Satiety stat.
tutoAction3Robot="Clear memory", reduces the Memory gauge of your Tamagotchi.
tutoSpecialRobot=Be careful ! The memory of the robot doesn't work like the rest, it must be as empty as possible.
tutoAction4="Play", increases your Tamagotchi's happiness but will exhaust him so it will take some time for him to play again.
tutoAction5="Yipee !\", very useful for impressing mom or dad.
tutoHealth=The Life stat increases when one gauge or more is full, but is reduced when one stat is at its lowest.\nWarning! The game stops if it reaches 0!
tutoMental=You also need to take into account your tamagotchi's mental state: if you take good care of it, it will increase. But if you don't, you'll make him very sad, or even worse...
